# Petal-Width-Prediction-Linear-Regression
Predict Iris flower species using Linear Regression on petal length and width. Visualized with Seaborn, this project shows how simple features can help estimate species numerically, highlighting patterns in petal dimensions for classification insight.
🌸 Predicting Iris Species using Petal Features and Linear Regression
📝 Project Description:
This project explores the widely known Iris dataset, using Linear Regression to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their petal length and width. While linear regression is typically used for numerical prediction, we adapt it here to provide an intuitive understanding of how flower species can be numerically inferred from physical characteristics.

The project showcases how even simple machine learning models can uncover patterns in nature, and how petal features alone are powerful indicators of species type.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn – for regression modeling

Seaborn & Matplotlib – for data visualization

Pandas & NumPy – for data preprocessing

📊 Features Used:
Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

🔁 Workflow:
Load and explore the Iris dataset.

Visualize petal features using scatter plots and regression lines.

Preprocess the data for regression modeling.

Train a Linear Regression model on the petal features.

Use the model to predict species in a numerical format.

Interpret and evaluate how well the model distinguishes between different Iris species.

Visualize prediction results and potential decision boundaries.

🎯 Outcome:
The model helps in predicting the species of Iris flowers by identifying patterns in their petal dimensions. This demonstrates that even a basic linear regression approach can be insightful for understanding natural classifications, especially when visualized clearly.

📈 Visual Insights:
Iris-setosa is easily separable using petal features.

Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica have closer petal dimensions but still show trends that linear models can learn from.
